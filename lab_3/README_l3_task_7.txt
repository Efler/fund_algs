1. App is parsing a text file only ONCE, for re-parsing a file just reboot the app.
2. Before using app, fill a text file only with format, described below:
    example of line: {Vladislav Petrov Vladimirovich 05.05.2016 male 1000.34}
   The app do a validation of symbols, but does not take responsibility for non-observance of the line format.
   Partial filling of data in the line is also not provided. Empty lines are not allowed
